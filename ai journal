WEEK 1
____________________________________
This week for the exercises I used AI to provide me an example of .strip() in use
I also used it to explain how to do fixed-width labels
I also had ai explain how to print decimals, and how to do string slicing

WEEK 2
_______________________________________
I asked ai on how to sort alphabetically
I asked AI for help in my logic for 19, was confused on how to have it check every piece while maintaining the all available state
I was confused about the string parsinng, so I used AI to provide me with a few examples and explanation of how it works
